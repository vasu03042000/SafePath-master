SafePath: a Safer Way to Venture
=============

Motivation
----------
We fully embrace HackGT 5's mantra: Dare to Venture. As Henry David Thoreau once said, "I went to the woods because I wished to live deliberately, to front only the essential facts of life, and see if I could not learn what it had to teach, and not, when I came to die, discover that I had not lived." 

In seeking adventure, however, it is difficult to (and important not to!) ignore the inevitable dangers lurking around every corner. This is particularly true of the University of Georgia Institute of Technology: located in the midst of epic crime, from consistent mugging to violent protests, it is of utmost concern to keep students safe. Therefore, we present to you the SafePath mobile application, developed using Android Studio.

How it Works
------------
When you register for an account on the application, you will specify one emergency contact phone number and a 4-digit PIN. Before embarking on a journey, pinpoint your starting point and ending destination on the Esri map located on the main interface. SafePath will calculate an efficient route for you to walk. As long as you stay within 50 meters of this path, SafePath will assume you are safe; however, upon deviation from this path (+ 50 meter radius), SafePath will notify your emergency contact that you are in trouble by sending an alerting text message to the specified phone number (with the initial permission of your emergency contact, of course.) There is a ten-second window before the text message is sent: if you are able to validate you are safe by correctly entering your 4-digit PIN, no text message will be sent.
